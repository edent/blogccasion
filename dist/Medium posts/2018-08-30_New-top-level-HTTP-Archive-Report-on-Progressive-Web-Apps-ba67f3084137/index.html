<p>As a follow-up from the <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/progressive-web-apps-in-the-http-archive-614d4bcf81fe">Progressive Web Apps study</a> from a couple of weeks ago, we’re now happy to announce that we’ve landed a new top-level <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps">HTTP Archive report on Progressive Web Apps</a> 🎉 based on the study’s raw data.</p>
<p>This report currently encompasses two sections: <em>(i)</em> <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps#pwaScores">PWA Scores</a> and <em>(ii)</em> <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps#swControlledPages">Service Worker Controlled Pages</a>, which translates roughly to <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/progressive-web-apps-in-the-http-archive-614d4bcf81fe#fd02">Approach 1</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/progressive-web-apps-in-the-http-archive-614d4bcf81fe#df00">Approach 2</a> of the <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/progressive-web-apps-in-the-http-archive-614d4bcf81fe">PWA study</a> mentioned above.</p>
<p>You can use this data for example to see the <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps?start=2017_08_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list#swControlledPages">percentages of pages that were controlled by a service worker</a> over time based on Chrome <code>[ServiceWorkerControlledPage](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/blink/public/platform/web_feature.mojom?l=651)</code> <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/blink/public/platform/web_feature.mojom?l=651">use counter</a> statistics. Good news: the trend is going up 📈.</p>

<p>As a result of <a href="https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi">Rick Viscomi</a>’s new 🧐 <a href="https://twitter.com/HTTPArchive/status/1031941537293205506">lenses</a> feature, you can now also dive into the data in an even more fine-grained manner, for example, to see the development of <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps?lens=wordpress&amp;start=2017_08_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list#pwaScores">median Lighthouse scores of just the <strong>Wordpress</strong> universe</a>. Note that while there was a switch in the Lighthouse scoring algorithm from <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/scoring#pwa">v2</a> to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring#pwa">v3</a> of the tool, the chart shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> score, which naturally is more robust in the presence of outliers.</p>

<p>Next steps entail also getting the data from <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/progressive-web-apps-in-the-http-archive-614d4bcf81fe#6d5e">Approach 3</a> of the study into the <code>httparchive.technologies.*</code> tables, so that we can allow everyone to run <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/blob/master/docs/bigquery-gettingstarted.md">BigQuery analyses</a> on top of these in a cost-efficient manner, without having to go through the massive (70+ TB) <code>httparchive.response_bodies.*</code> tables!</p>
<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi">Rick</a> again, whose guidance and leadership were essential to make this happen. We’re looking forward to this data being put to good use.</p>
