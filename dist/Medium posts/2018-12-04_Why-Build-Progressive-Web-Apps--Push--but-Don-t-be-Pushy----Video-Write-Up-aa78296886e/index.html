<p>Let‚Äôs face it, on the web, push notifications have become a bit of an omnipresent annoyance. The reason for the bad reputation of push notifications‚Äîin my opinion‚Äîis that we have been, well, a bit too <em>‚Äúpushy‚Äù</em> in trying to get people to allow them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy Build Progressive Web Apps,‚Äù episode 2: Push, but Don‚Äôt Be Pushy!</p>
<p>The folks over at Mozilla have phrased it like this in a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/no-notifications/">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúOnline, your attention is priceless. That‚Äôs why every site in the universe wants permission to send you notifications about new stuff. It can be distracting at best and annoying at worst.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A particularly <em>bad practice</em> is to pop up the permission dialog on page load, without any context at all. Several high traffic sites have been caught doing this. To subscribe people to push notifications, you use the the <code>[PushManager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager)</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager">interface</a>. Now to be fair, this does not allow the developer to specify the context or the to-be-expected frequency of notifications. So where does this leave us?</p>
<p>const options = {<br>
userVisibleOnly: true,<br>
applicationServerKey: APPLICATION_SERVER_KEY,<br>
// No way to specify context or frequency ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø<br>
};<br>
<em>const subscription = await</em> reg.pushManager.subscribe(<em>options</em>);</p>
<p>First, maybe let‚Äôs take one step back and brainstorm why we would want push notifications in the first place. If done right, <strong><em>push notifications are actually pretty great</em></strong>. For example, they can inform you if you have been <em>outbid</em> on an auction site. They can alert you about <em>severe weather conditions</em> in your hometown. On a less serious note, they can notify you when you have a <em>match on a dating site</em>. Or they can let you know if there‚Äôs a significant <em>price drop</em> for something you‚Äôre interested in. And yes, of course push notifications can also <em>inform you of new content</em> on a news site.</p>
<p>As I wrote above, there is no way on the API-level to inform users about the context of push notifications. All you can do with the options parameter is set a flag whether the notifications should be <code>userVisibleOnly</code>, and provide the <code>applicationServerKey</code>. In consequence, it‚Äôs crucial that we as application developers provide the context for our notifications ourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe you remember the <a href="https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/">üêà AffiliCats</a> sample app from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK_TDTTWnQ">first episode</a> of ‚ÄúWhy Build Progressive Web Apps.‚Äù It‚Äôs a simple app that simulates a comparison site where you can get great offers for cats. What‚Äôs new this time is a <strong><em>button for getting price drop</em></strong> alerts.</p>

üêà AffiliCats app with price drop alerts (Source: <a href="https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/">https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/</a>).</p>
<p>When you press it for the <em>very</em> first time, the notifications permissions prompt pops up, and it‚Äôs immediately clear that it‚Äôs related to the price drop alerts.</p>

<p>If you grant permission, the app subscribes you to a push notification endpoint that is configured to send out dummy notifications, and after a couple of seconds after subscribing, you should receive your first notification.</p>

<p>So you can see, prices for cats are dropping, you better get one while they last. And there we have it, an actually useful push notification. It was <em>contextual</em>, <em>meaningful</em>, and <em>timely</em>. The <a href="https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/">üêà AffiliCats</a> app is open source, go check out the <a href="https://github.com/googlechromelabs/affilicats">source code</a> if you want to see how it‚Äôs implemented. Push notifications are a great power, and with great power comes great responsibility. If you remember one thing from this write-up, I hope it‚Äôs <strong><em>context matters</em></strong>!</p>
