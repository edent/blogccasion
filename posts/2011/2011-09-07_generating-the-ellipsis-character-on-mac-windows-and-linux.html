<b>Generating the ellipsis character on Mac, Windows, Linux</b><br />
<br />
Maybe this comes in handy for someone else besides me: to generate the ellipsis character ("<span style="font-weight:bold;">&hellip;</span>")<sup>*</sup> on a Mac keyboard, press <strong>[Option] + [;]</strong> on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DLDO4U?ie=UTF8&tag=blogccasion-20&link_code=as2&camp=212361&creative=380601&creativeASIN=B005DLDO4U">QWERTY</a> keyboard, and (more logic) <strong>[Option] + [.]</strong> on a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002NX0M82?ie=UTF8&tag=blogccasion-21&link_code=as2&camp=2474&creative=9066&creativeASIN=B002NX0M82">QWERTZ</a> keyboard. <strong>[Option]</strong> is also known as <strong>[Alt]</strong> for all Mac newbies. Typography geeks might love this, but I'm also looking at you, anonymous Twitter user, where every character counts... (‚Üê three dots, pun intended).<br />
<br />
Addendum 1: <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">Danny Ayers</a> points out that on Linux you can use <strong>[Ctrl]  + [Shift] + [u]</strong> (for Unicode) and then <strong>[2], [0], [2], [6], [Enter]</strong>. Or &amp;#x2026; in HTML.<br />
<br />
Addendum 2: <a href="http://portenkirchner.net/">Georg Portenkirchner</a> points out that on Windows you can press and hold <strong>[Alt]</strong>, and then press <strong>[0], [1], [3], [3]</strong> on the numpad, and finally release <strong>[Alt]</strong>. He writes <i>five keystrokes for three dots -- that's just stupid (and probably why nobody uses the correct ellipsis)</i>. Nothing to be added to that&hellip;<br />
<br />
<sup>*)</sup> <small>The ellipsis character is also known as "three dots", "triple dots", "dot, dot, dot", or "\ldots" in LaTeX, or as HTML entity "&amp;hellip;").</small>
